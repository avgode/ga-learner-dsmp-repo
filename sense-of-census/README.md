### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I will have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, I have applied the following concepts:

Array Appending
Array Slicing
Array Filtering
Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Analysed the DATA carefully, understand it and read the problem statement till the time I'm understand it and then only approached for coding it.
