### Project Overview

 We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.



### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project,  I had a better understanding of solving logical problems using python. In this project, I have applied following concepts:

- String operations
- Conditional statement and loops
- File I/O
- Functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I tried to apply the concepts which I learned till now. 


### Challenges faced

 Stuck at some places to understand the concepts and also got some exceptions. So, referred the websites such as GeeksForGeeks.org, stackoverflow.com for more understandings.
